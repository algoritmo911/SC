# Sapiens Coin Tokenomics

This document describes the economic model and tokenomics of Sapiens Coin (SC).

## Fundamental Principles

- **Universal Basic Issuance:** Каждый человек получает 1 SC. This foundational principle ensures broad initial distribution.
- **Value Accrual:** Стоимость монеты наполняется через знания, творчество и вклад. The value of SC is intrinsically linked to the productive output and intellectual capital generated within the ecosystem.

## Token Variations

- **Локальные SC (Local SC):** The system includes localized versions of SC, such as SC-ES (Spain), SC-CN (China), etc. This suggests a model where SC can be adapted or pegged to local economic contexts, or that there are distinct but related local tokens. The exact mechanics of these local SCs (e.g., exchange rates with a global SC, local governance) are to be detailed.

*(Further details on token supply, inflation/deflation mechanisms, distribution schedules, utility of the token within the platform, and economic incentives will be elaborated here.)*
