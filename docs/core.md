# Sapiens Coin Core Concepts

This document outlines the core philosophical, architectural, and security principles of Sapiens Coin.

## Philosophical Foundations

- **Inherent Value:** The core idea is that every individual is entitled to Sapiens Coin ("каждый человек получает 1 SC"), and its value is derived from human endeavor: "стоимость монеты наполняется через знания, творчество и вклад."
- **Abstract Elements:** The system incorporates concepts like "Аттракторы, метафизика, память, карта переходов и т.п." These likely refer to underlying mechanisms influencing coin dynamics, value perception, or system evolution. Their precise technical or philosophical interpretation needs further elaboration.

## Architectural Highlights

- **Localized Variants:** The existence of "Локальные SC: SC-ES, SC-CN..." points towards a distributed or adaptable architecture that can cater to regional specifics.
- **DAO Integration:** "DAO-ноды" are a key architectural component, indicating a move towards decentralized governance and operations.
- **Security Systems:** "FlowShield Katana" is a designated system for DDoS protection, described metaphorically as a snake swallowing the load ("по аналогии со змеёй, глотающей нагрузку"). This highlights a proactive approach to security.

## Key Components (Summary from ideas)

- **Economy:** Universal issuance, value from contribution, local SC variants.
- **Philosophy:** Intrinsic human value, knowledge/creativity backing, abstract system dynamics.
- **Security:** FlowShield Katana for DDoS.
- **DAO:** DAO nodes for decentralized control.
- **Subjects:** Individuals as initial recipients of SC.
- **Architecture:** Local SCs, DAO nodes, specific security modules, abstract operational concepts.
